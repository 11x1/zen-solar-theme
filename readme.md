## Quick setup for Solar
To use Solar, follow [the official documentation](https://docs.zen-browser.app/guides/live-editing) to set up Zen's `chrome` folder and `userChrome.css` stylesheet.
After that clone or download the repository in the `chrome` folder and add this line to your `chrome\userChrome.css`
```css
@import "zen-solar-theme/solar.css"
```

After everything your `chrome` folder should look something like this
